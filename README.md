# text-editor

 UCF Bootcamp Node.js, PWA
## Project Decscription
In this project, I used Node.js and several webpack plugins to add on to starter code in order to create a progressive web application (a simple text editor) that can function on and offline. IndexedDB was used to store data through the browser.
